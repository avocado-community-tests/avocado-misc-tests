mdadm - manage MD devices aka Linux Software RAID 

Values to be passed in yaml file:

* Devices on which this scripts should be run. disks: "/dev/sdx /dev/sdy ..." (space separated disks)

* Raid Name to be created, optional parameter.

* Raid levels to be created

* metadata levels for raid

* spare disks (space separated disks) [optional parameter]

* required disks - This is a configurable value of minimum required disks for each raid level.
  Usually, it is 2 for RAID1, 3 for RAID5 and RAID10 and 4 for RAID6.

Note: Please specify minimum of 5 disks, for creating all levels of software
raid. If 5 disks are not available, create 5 partitions, and specify those
partitions in the yaml file.
For testing RAID 1 minimum 3 disks or 3 partitions are required so that
the third disk/partition can be added as spare to test failover.
Test fails, if number of disks are not applicable for a certain raid level.
